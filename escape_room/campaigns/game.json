As you know I am Jennifer Shuford, the Commissioner of the Texas Department of Health and Human Services.\nWe've just received an urgent report of a rapidly unfolding public health crisis and I need your help. We have a cluster of critically ill patients, and we may have an outbreak, but we are not sure.  I need your investigative skills to help sort through this.  The situation is escalating quickly, the governor wants answers now and CNN is calling me. I am getting reports from many regions and cases are climbing, and we need answers—now! The clock is ticking, and lives are at stake, we do not have much time.\nThat's why we're calling on you, our brightest and most talented epidemiology team, to step into action. Your mission: determine if there is an outbreak and if so investigate the source, define the cases, identify the agent, and recommend containment strategies so we can protect our public.  We need to stop this situation in its tracks.\nYou have limited time, the needed critical resources, and only your expertise to guide you. The health of Texans depends on you. We’re counting on you to solve the mystery and provide me with guidance needed to implement any measures needed to protect the public.\nThank you and good luck—get to work.",
